				<p>Three weeks into mentoring a new colleague, Dolly Bindon—a hospital nurse in Colorado—finally ate lunch with her trainee for the first time. They sat down at an outdoor table and pulled down their masks. </p>


				<p>“I saw the bottom half of her face for the first time,” says Bindon. “We were together three days a week, 12 hours a day, for three, four weeks. And I was like, ‘huh, who knew? That’s what your face looks like?’”</p>


				<p>
					It's been over eight months since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and masks aren't going away anytime soon. <a href="https://masks4all.co/what-states-require-masks/">Every U.S. State but South Dakota</a>
					now requires them in some public settings. Even
					basic cloth face coverings likely reduce transmission
					of the virus by <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=mask-use&tab=trend">30% or more</a>, and without a vaccine, <a
						href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext">masks remain one of our best lines of defense</a>. But, when worn correctly, masks make it more difficult to read others’ expressions.
				</p>

				<p>
					With the mouth, cheeks, and chin obscured, it’s harder to recognize and interpret other people’s faces and emotions. Without emotional recognition, conversations are uninflected, “just like reading words on a page with no punctuation,” says
					<a href="https://www.davidmatsumoto.com/">David Matsumoto</a>, a psychologist who studies nonverbal expression at San Francisco State University.
				</p>

				<p>
					Fortunately, there’s a rich body of psychological research that can help us navigate this strange moment-- a time when we often can only guess what someone is thinking behind the mask. Here are some questions and answers about the science
					of facial expression and recognition.
				</p>

				<h3>
					How do people communicate emotion?
				</h3>

				<p>
					With words, people can directly say what they feel. But we also rely heavily on non-verbal cues: tone of voice, gesture, touch, body language, and facial expressions. “The channel that communicates the most specific emotional states is the
					face,” Matsumoto says.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the 1970s, psychologist Paul Eckman <a href="https://1ammce38pkj41n8xkp1iocwe-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Universal-Facial-Expressions-of-Emotions1.pdf">classified a set of basic emotions</a>. To be considered
					basic, an emotion has to be universal across cultures, expressed through certain shared facial expressions, and spontaneous—meaning that it happens organically in response to an appropriate trigger. “Like, for example, you see a bear,
					you're scared,” explains <a href="https://chan.usc.edu/people/faculty/Lisa_Aziz-Zadeh" target="_blank">Lisa Aziz-Zadeh</a>, a cognitive neuroscientist at University of Southern California. Today, most experts in psychology and neuroscience
					agree that there are six of these basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise.
				</p>

				<p>
					Expressing a basic emotion gets the full face involved. “It’s not just in the mouth…there’s an associated pattern of muscles for the eyes, for the cheeks, for the eyebrows,” says Aziz-Zadeh. Surprise and fear trigger the eyes to open wider,
					while disgust is shown in a wrinkle at the bridge of the nose. Happiness is expressed in the corners of the eyes and upper cheeks. Some of these basic emotions share facial trademarks, like the close-knit brows of disgust and anger, but
					there are enough unique characteristics of each—especially when the whole face can be seen and assessed —that most people can tell these expressions apart.
				</p>

				<h3>What gets lost with masks?</h3>

				<p>
					Not all emotions are shown in every part of the face, though. Matsumoto says contempt, sometimes also considered a basic emotion because of its universality, is often only demonstrated through a small twist of the mouth. More subtle
					expressions, combinations of emotions, or the intensity of an emotion can all become much harder to interpret when the lower face is covered.
				</p>

				<p>
					“If you’re covering the face, you are impoverishing the whole visual experience,” explains <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/roxane-itier" target="_blank">Roxane Itier</a>, a cognitive neuroscientist at University of
					Waterloo. The time it takes to read other peoples’ facial expressions likely increases when masks are worn, says Itier, while the accuracy of those interpretations goes down. “Humans didn’t evolve to read half the face,” says Matsumoto.
				</p>

				<p>
					Further, people on the autism spectrum might struggle more than neuro-typical people with masked communication, according to experts. Some people with autism focus their attention mostly on the mouth, and “explicitly avoid looking at the
					eyes,” says Aziz-Zadeh. To better communicate with people who rely on the mouth for emotional cues, Aziz-Zadeh recommends <a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/heres-where-to-buy-clear-face-masks-in-2020/" target="_blank">masks with clear
						inserts</a>, which also aid deaf and heard-of-hearing people who use lip reading. But, clear masks are more expensive and less readily available compared with standard masks.
				</p>

				<h3>What can we do to compensate?</h3>

				<p>
					Masks save lives – by one <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america?view=mask-use&tab=trend" target="_blank">analysis</a>, 95% mask compliance could save as many as 100,000 lives in the U.S. through January 2021 – so
					sacrificing proper mask wearing just to see a stranger’s smile is not a good trade-off.
				</p>

				<p>
					But Matsumoto says all is not lost. “I think that there’s good things to be said about communicating well, even with masks,” he says. With all the other modes of emotional communication at play, missing out on the mouth doesn’t have to stop
					humans from understanding each other.
				</p>

				<p>
					“People are very ingenious in finding ways to compensate and adapt to the environment, because communication is so, so vital,” he explains. People can use gestures to emphasize emotion or touch, says Matsumoto, and even balance a masked
					face with words. Telling someone that you’re smiling, surprised, or upset is an efficient way to make sure they understand you, and we do it all the time in phone conversations.
				</p>

				<p>
					Further, remember that even in a non-pandemic reality, facial expressions are rarely the sole means of nonverbal communication. “We also use context enormously,” says Itier. For example, that scary bear might illicit a similar face to
					walking in on your own surprise party, but observers would interpret those expressions differently. Cueing into conversational context clues is often unconscious, but you can purposely increase your observational efforts as well by actively
					listening.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you’re still concerned with understanding peoples’ emotions and sharing your own, you could purchase a clear mask, focus more on tone of voice, or you could just look to the eyes, which are key in expressing all of those 6 basic
					emotions. After all, in professions like nursing, masks have long-been commonplace—and healthcare workers still manage to communicate effectively.
				</p>

				<p>
					Even so, Dolly Bindon says things do feel different at her Colorado hospital now. Some of the lighthearted exchanges she’s used to don’t translate as well when both patients and health care workers are masked.
				</p>
				<p>
					“We have to ask patients every day: ‘Where are you? What's your name? What day is it?’ And sometimes they’ll be like making a dad joke, which has always happened in the history of every patient in the hospital ever. And they pretend that
					they don't know what day it is…But like, I don't know, if you're wearing a mask—joking? Are you serious? I don't know.”

				<h4>Answer Key</h4>

				<ol>
					<li><b>Anger: </b>The low, furrowed brow is a sign of anger visible above the mask—the tightened lips and flared nostrils are other signs of anger hidden by the mask.</li>
					<li><b>Disgust: </b>The wrinkled upper nose, knit brow, and narrowed eyes are signs of disgust visible above the mask—the lower nose wrinkle and mouth position are other signs of disgust hidden by the mask).</li>
					<li><b>Fear: </b>The widened eyes with visible whites and raised brows are signs of fear visible above the mask—the flared nostrils and grimace are other signs of disgust hidden by the mask.</li>
					<li><b>Happiness: </b>The upturned corners of the eyes and raised cheeks are signs of happiness visible above the mask—the wide smile is a sign of happiness hidden by the mask.</li>
					<li><b>Sadness: </b>The slightly knit brows, and downturned corners of the eyes are signs of sadness visible above the mask—the frown or pout is a sign of sadness hidden by the mask.</li>
					<li><b>Surprise: </b>The slightly raised eyebrows and widened eyes are signs of surprise visible above the mask—the open mouth is a sign of surprise hidden by the mask. Without the lower face, it can be hard to tell surprise from fear, so
						context is important.</li>
					<li><b>Contempt: </b>The eyes and brow look neutral, and contempt is difficult to spot above the mask. Below the mask though, the sideways mouth position is indicative of contempt.</li>
